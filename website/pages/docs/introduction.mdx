# Introduction

> It's my first time open-sourcing a serious project, and I want to increase my chances of having a positive experience. I hope this helps us communicate the right expectations on my work.

The Camara homepage provides expanded guidance and documentation on the design language, component library and style/pattern guide. I want my users to have as much information as possible while exploring Camara.

If you’re new to Camara, start with my [getting started guide](/docs/start/get-started). It has everything you need to design and develop your side projects with Camara.

## Production Use

Camara isn’t ready for production use yet, but I want to give you an early preview of what’s coming. I'd love you to give it a try. As always, I encourage feedback and contributions. I plan to get it out of beta before mid-summer in July and start accepting contributions.

## Contributions

This project will be open for contributions at version 1.0, right now, my only goal is to show off my work (what I am building) while still working on it publicly. The focus is on getting it to where I feel would be a solid start to my vision - helping you build your ideas quickly and with less code.

You will notice the absence of a contribution guide, and some other piece of a regular open-source project. These are things I am gearing work on and making plans to make them available as soon as I begin accepting contributions.

While I could easily keep working on this in stealth and release when I am ready, I do not think this is the right decision for us at this moment. I am huge advocates of working in public and are proud to show my initial ideas while documenting my progress to where I want to go.
Also, building in public keeps us much more accountable and helps fuel my momentum to get my ideas out. I hope you understand this and are excited as much as I look forward to Camara V1.
