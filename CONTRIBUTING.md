# Contributing

This project will be open for contributions at version 1.0, right now, my only goal is to show off my work(what I am building) while still working on it publicly. The focus is on getting it to where I feel would be a solid start to my vision - helping you build your ideas quickly and with less code.

You will notice the absence of a contribution guide, and some other piece of a regular open-source project. These are things I am gearing work on and making plans to make them available as soon as I begin accepting contributions.

While I could easily keep working on this in stealth and release when I am ready, I do not think this is the right decision for us at this moment. I am huge advocates of working in public and are proud to show my initial ideas while documenting my progress to where I want to go.
Also, building in public keeps us much more accountable and helps fuel my momentum to get my ideas out. I hope you understand this and are excited as much as I look forward to Camara V1.
